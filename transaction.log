Session 2
Investigated a mining facility. There was a weird robot. Most of the people were
murdered. There also happened to be pirates who are activley sabotaging the
energy shields. We decided to go deeper to find the killers.

Session 3
Fought 6 droids.
Used Elbow Smash 3 times.
We found a spooky door with 4 slots for coins like the one we found. There is
also a slot in the middle. A final key? We put the coin we had in there.
It pulses. I also had a flashback and a haunting vision. Flashback of how my
master died. And vision of a vast spooky plain with an orange sky. Picture
Vormir. I saw my allies fighting in a bunch of little battles. And a hooded
figure approached me and put up his fists, ready to battle.
We encountered a lady with a vibroblade. One of the 3 we saw in that military
encampment. She force screamed and then ran away.
