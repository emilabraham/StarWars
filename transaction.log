Session 2
Investigated a mining facility. There was a weird robot. Most of the people were
murdered. There also happened to be pirates who are activley sabotaging the
energy shields. We decided to go deeper to find the killers.

Session 3
Fought 6 droids.
Used Elbow Smash 3 times.
We found a spooky door with 4 slots for coins like the one we found. There is
also a slot in the middle. A final key? We put the coin we had in there.
It pulses. I also had a flashback and a haunting vision. Flashback of how my
master died. And vision of a vast spooky plain with an orange sky. Picture
Vormir. In the sky there was a great winged beast, kind of like a dragon.
I saw my allies fighting in a bunch of little battles below. And a hooded
figure approached me and put up his fists, ready to battle.

We encountered a lady with a vibroblade. One of the 3 we saw in that military
encampment. She force screamed and then ran away.

Session 4(Start of a new system)
We reported back to Neet Dang and told him about everything. Including the door.

We just did a combat training session and fought a bunch of droids. We learned
about combat.

Session 5
I used 3 Force points to reduce my dark side points by 3.
We go to a farm that has stopped producing crops for Neet Dang. They produce
corn, beans, and wheat. They stopped producing because the White Moon Syndicate
came and offered them a deal. When they arrived, they also fucked up the corn
crop. The corn was behaving weird. Some was getting old too quick. Some was too
young. The source of the weird behavior was at the 2 execution pillars. We
pulled them out and shot them into the sun. When we returned, a rift had opened.
We stepped through the rift. Turns out we went a month back in time to right
when the White Moon Syndicate arrived. The Twilek with the vibroblade was there.
We stopped them and took the twilek and one of the guards captive. When we slept
after the long battle, Matt had a vision and learned the Fold Space force
ability. The next morning we interrogated the captives. The captive said they
are making rifts to help build a tree that can power the Ultimate Artifical
Intelligence(UAI).
