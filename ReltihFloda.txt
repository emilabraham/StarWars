Background:
A Noghri orphan who was raised by a Aiki/Shimura Jedi/Monk. An assassin was sent
to kill the monk. She came back from the market only to find the house covered
in the monk's blood and her guardian missing. Fear and adrenaline coursing through
her system, she tracked down the assailant to the edge of the river. Where she
surprised him and ripped him to shreds. Looking at the blood on her hands, she
realized that she was no different from the assailant who took her guardian's
life. She recalled the teachings of her guardian to never kill.

She vowed never to kill again and to always give her opponent a fair fighting
chance. If a fight was even necessary at all.

The body of her guardian was lost to the river...

Personality:
She always fights to the level of her opponent. She will never try to
dramatically overpower her opponent. This is one of her greatest flaws. Often
giving opponents a second chance if they show a strong will to fight.

Advantages & Disadvantage:
Extremely Competitive (+1D)
Fanatic (+3D)

Objective: To become the strongest martial artist in the galaxy. She seeks out
the galaxies strongest fighters.

A Quote:
With great power comes great responsibility
Strength is justice. Strength is absolute.

Connection With Characters:
Friends:
Phesoj Nilats, my late master. He found me as a child abandoned in Coruscant.
Oam Gnodez, my landlord at the apartment I stay at rent free. In exchange for
protection from the remaining Sith and their followers.

Enemies:
Sith assassins. They are the ones that killed my master. If they and their ilk
managed to kill my master, they will be worthy opponents to test my strength.
